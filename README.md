# Kantemba-Supplies

**This project was a requirement for my Systems Design and Implementation assignment.**

**The scenario states:**
\_"Mr Chuma runs three tuntempaâ€™s (small grocery shop) but one of his main challenges is getting to order groceries from his suppliers in Kamwala. This usually forces him to close his shop for more than four hours and thus losing customers. His niece Anne told him she is a student at Unilus in BIT and that she can create a simple mobile application that he can use to find and buy the groceries from his Kamwala suppliers.

You are playing the role of the niece; your tasks are to build an
android/iPhone app that does as follows:

- Help Mr Chuma to see the products and the suppliers
- Buy them
- Enquire for further details
- Get a quotation
- Any enhancements are bonus points
